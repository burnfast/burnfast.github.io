Cardiolipin antibodies are classified as autoantibodies that act against the body’s own cardiolipins.

<p>The iga ( immunoglobulin a) test detects the presence of the cardiolipin antibodies in the blood. Phospholipid (cardiolipin) antibodies must be detected on 2 or more occasions at least 12 weeks apart to fulfill the laboratory diagnostic criteria for aps. Moderate to high levels of cardiolipin antibodies that persist when tested again 12 weeks later indicate the likely continued presence of that specific antibody, which may be associated with an increased risk of excessive clotting or recurrent miscarriages.
