Coronary artery disease (cad) and stroke are two of the deadliest health problems in the united states. The coronary artery is blocked by the clot long enough to cause irreversible damage. Common signs include chest pain or pressure ( angina ), shortness of breath (dyspnea) or dizziness. The aim of the present study was to explore the relationship between cyps and ischemic heart.
