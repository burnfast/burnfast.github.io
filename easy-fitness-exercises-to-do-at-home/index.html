Easy Daily Workout From darebee.com
People who have no equipment can still get an amazing workout at home— or in a hotel room, a park, or anywhere else you happen to be. Lie on your back with hands behind your head, knees bent at 90 degrees, feet together on a flat surface. If you want more of a challenge with squats, simply grab two soup cans from the cupboard to hold as weights, or use dumbbells. It’s important to stay hydrated before, during, and after exercising.
