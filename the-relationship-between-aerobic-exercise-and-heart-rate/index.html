The relationship between the percentage of heart rate reserve (%hrr) and percentage of oxygen uptake reserve (%vo₂r) has been recommended for prescribing aerobic exercise intensity. Two of the key functions of the cardiovascular system are to: To get the most out of your aerobic exercise program, you should select a. The main objective of doing cardiovascular exercise is to have the ideal heart rate and have a good heart rate for our heart.
