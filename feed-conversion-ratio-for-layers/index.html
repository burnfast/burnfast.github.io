<p>Feed accounts for the greatest proportion of egg production costs and there is substantial variation in feed to egg conversion ratio (fcr) efficiency between individual hens. In this video, our veterinarian doc jun compares broiler and layer poultry farming with regard to feed conversion ratio and feeding strategy. For example, if it requires two kilograms of feed to grow one kilogram of fish, the fcr would be two. The feed conversion ratio (fcr) and residual feed intake (rfi) are common indexes in measuring feed efficiency for livestock.</p>

In animal husbandry, feed conversion ratio (fcr) is a measure of an animalâs efficiency in converting feed into increased body mass. Feed accounts for the greatest proportion of egg production costs and there is substantial variation in feed to egg conversion ratio (fcr) efficiency between individual hens.

<p>Feed conversion ratio (fcr) the feed conversion ratio (fcr) is the number of units of feed an animal uses to produce one unitof product. Laying hens in modern commercial flocks typically produce about 330 eggs per year with a fcr of 2. Checking table 1 we find that the $280 per ton feed costs 30.8 cents per pound of gain; In this example, it would obviously be more economical to purchase the most expensive 36 % protein fish food.

<p>The feed conversion ratio (fcr) provides the relationship between feed consumed and feed efficiency, which helps us answer this crucial question. Laying hens in modern commercial flocks typically produce about 330 eggs per year with a fcr of 2. The fcr is simply the amount of feed it takes to grow a kilogram of fish. The feed conversion ratio (fcr) and residual feed intake (rfi) are common indexes in measuring feed efficiency for livestock. (PDF) Metabolizable energy and oil intake in brown commercial layers.</p>
