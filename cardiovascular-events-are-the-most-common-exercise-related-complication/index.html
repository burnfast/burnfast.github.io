<p>Heart attacks and strokes are usually acute events and are mainly caused by a blockage that prevents blood from flowing to the heart or brain. Some conditions, such as type 2 diabetes or hypertension, may initially cause no symptoms at all. Hereditary or congenital cardiovascular abnormalities are predominantly responsible for cardiac events among young individuals, whereas atherosclerotic disease is primarily responsible for these events in adults. These occur from repetitive micro traumas to tissue which eventually lead to the tissue starting to fail.</p>
