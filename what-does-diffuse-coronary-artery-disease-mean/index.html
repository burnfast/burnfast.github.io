Anterograde flow compromise of a patent left internal mammary artery From elsevier.es
For some people, the first sign of cad is a heart attack. The posterior descending artery was considered part of either the rca or lcx system, depending upon the coronary artery dominance. The following results were obtained: You and your health care team may be able to help reduce your risk for cad.

<p>Coronary artery disease (cad) is a medical condition which involves damage to the major blood vessels that provide the heart with oxygen and nutrients. Cad is usually caused by cholesterol deposits called plaques that cause inflammation and narrowing of the coronary arteries. In sections stained specifically for mineral, staining was diffuse and present in all atherosclerotic plaques. Routine coronary artery bypass graft (cabg) surgery in diffuse cad may result in incomplete revascularization and there is a high chance of early graft occlusion due to poor distal flow.</p>
