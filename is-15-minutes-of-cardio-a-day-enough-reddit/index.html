<p>The answer is that it depends. In the uk it is recommended that an adult should aim to get 2 hours 30 minutes of moderate intensity cardio, but this can be achieved with a brisk walk or cycling or 75 minutes of vigorous intensity cardio. Significant benefits can be had from 20 mnutes of cardio or even 10 minutes of hiit or as little as 4 minutes of tabata hiit. 45 minutes is more time than most people need to spend at the gym if you're not dicking around wasting time taking. .</p>
