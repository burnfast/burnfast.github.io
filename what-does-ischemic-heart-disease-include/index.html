Heart disease that occurs as a result of inadequate blood supply to the myocardium, as in myocardial infarction and angina pectoris. As the plaque enlarges, it gradually obstructs.

<p>In general, ischemic heart disease or myocardial ischemia refers to conditions that involve narrowing or blocking the blood vessels or coronary arteries, preventing the heart muscle from receiving enough oxygen. It is mainly due to some pathology in the coronary arteries (the arteries supplying the heart muscle with blood, oxygen and nutrients). This may lead to a panic attack, a heartbeat thatâs not normal, and heat loss.
