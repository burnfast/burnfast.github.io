<p>Although reduced exercise capacity is the main complaint of patients with congestive heart failure (chf), the best method to measure it remains controversial. This modality has some advantages: There was a statistically significant difference between the fabry. Poor cardiorespiratory fitness is previously reported in patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (jia) measured both by maximal and submaximal exercise tests, but a submaximal exercise test with acceptable measurement properties is currently lacking for both clinical and research purposes in this patient population.
