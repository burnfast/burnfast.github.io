What does cell respiration mean? Cellular respiration takes place in the cells of all organisms. [1] the reactions involved in respiration are catabolic reactions, which break large molecules into smaller ones, releasing energy. Cellular respiration is a series of metabolic reactions that occur within the cells of organisms (both plants and animals) to convert biochemical energy derived from nutrients to adenosine triphosphate (atp) and then release waste products.

<p>Although much of the energy from cellular respiration is released as heat, some of it is used to make atp. Cellular respiration is a series of chemical reactions that break down glucose to produce atp, which may be used as energy to power many reactions throughout the body. Glycolysis, the citric acid cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation. The process plays an essential role in maintaining the biological functions of all living cells.
