<p>Aerobic respiration is important because it is the primary way that your cells produce energy. During rigorous exercise, the anaerobic respiration response leads to the production of lactic acid within muscle cells, which facilitates the production of atp, helping to provide additional energy. It decreases the risk of health conditions such as heart disease, high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes. Aerobic exercise, energy in anaerobic training comes from muscles.
