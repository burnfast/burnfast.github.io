<meta name="description" content="Free Maximum Aerobic Capacity In Office, Maximal aerobic power describes the functional capacity of the cardiorespiratory system and is defined as the maximum rate at which oxygen can be used during a specified period, usually during intense exercise. 5 x 15 sec at 100% mas (76m) with 15 sec active recovery.
Maximal aerobic capacity across age in healthy Hispanic and Caucasian From journals.physiology.org
An example session may look like this: This in scientific terms is your aerobic capacity 1. It’s a reflection of your aerobic power and your body’s ability to keep performing under strenuous activity for longer periods of time. Basically mas represents the minimum speed required to obtain your maximum oxygen uptake.
