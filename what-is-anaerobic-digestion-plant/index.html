Anaerobic digestion happens in closed spaces where there is no air (or oxygen). It may have been used to heat water as early as the 10th century bc and the first plant was built in bombay, india in 1859. 2021/07/12 although anaerobic digestion of small amount of organic and food waste was considered unprofitable a few years ago, it is growing today with a new model of biogas production: One of the major pros of anaerobic digesters is that it can offer a constant power supply to the universe.
