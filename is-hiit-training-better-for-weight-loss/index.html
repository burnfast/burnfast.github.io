Hiit and weight training are the same and totally different at the same time. While the calories you burn during steady state cardio are from fat, you will not burn as many calories or burn as much in the short amount of time as you would during hiit. So if you value time and you don’t have enough time in the day, you might want to choose this type of workout. With respect to weight loss, current science does not present strong, consistent evidence that either hiit or moderate intensity continuous training (mict) is superior for weight loss.
