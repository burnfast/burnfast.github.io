Low levels of IgM antibodies to oxidized cardiolipin increase and high From bmccardiovascdisord.biomedcentral.com
Cardiolipin is a phospholipid, or a kind of fat in the blood that is important for blood clotting. An antibody is a substance in your blood that helps fight infection. If you have ?s, see a clinical immunologist. I would like to know what having an elevated cardiolipin igm means.

<p>However, a higher concentration of antibodies may be a strong indication of autoimmune disease [ 5 ]. Autoimmune antibodies can be formed against natural (normal) cell surface proteins.when this happens, adverse effects can occur. Since cardiolipin antibodies are the most common of the antiphospholipid antibodies, it is not unusual to find them emerging, temporarily due to an infection or drug, or asymptomatically as a person ages. Antibodies to various antigens are a characterisitic of anti phospholipid syndrome like syphilis, cardiolipin antibodies and lupus anticoagulant. PPT Syphilis PowerPoint Presentation ID755282.</p>
