Low levels of IgM antibodies to oxidized cardiolipin increase and high From bmccardiovascdisord.biomedcentral.com
Cardiolipin is a phospholipid, or a kind of fat in the blood that is important for blood clotting. An antibody is a substance in your blood that helps fight infection. If you have ?s, see a clinical immunologist. I would like to know what having an elevated cardiolipin igm means.

These autoantibodies can affect the body’s ability to regulate blood clotting in a way that is not well understood.

Tests for igg and igm cardiolipin antibodies are frequently ordered to help determine the cause of an unexplained thrombotic episode, recurrent miscarriage, or thrombocytopenia.they may be ordered along with lupus anticoagulant testing to help investigate the cause of a prolonged ptt (activated partial thromboplastin time), especially if clinical findings suggest that the patient.

<p>I would like to know what having an elevated cardiolipin igm means. High levels of the igm isotype are associated with autoimmune hemolytic anemia, a condition in which an individual’s immune system attacks their red blood cells.

<p>However, a higher concentration of antibodies may be a strong indication of autoimmune disease [ 5 ]. Autoimmune antibodies can be formed against natural (normal) cell surface proteins.when this happens, adverse effects can occur. Since cardiolipin antibodies are the most common of the antiphospholipid antibodies, it is not unusual to find them emerging, temporarily due to an infection or drug, or asymptomatically as a person ages. Antibodies to various antigens are a characterisitic of anti phospholipid syndrome like syphilis, cardiolipin antibodies and lupus anticoagulant. PPT Syphilis PowerPoint Presentation ID755282.</p>
