<p>Platelets, blood cells that help blood to clot, also get used up. A negative anticardiolipin igg or igm result indicates that this type of antibody was not present or was present in too small a quantity in the blood sample being tested. What does it mean if your anticardiolipin ab,igg,qn result is too low? The anti cardiolipin igm antibody test enables you to diagnose inappropriate blood clot, analyze the cause for regular miscarriages, and analyze any autoimmune diseases.

Since igm are antibodies formed in response to a first time infection, high levels could mean a new infection. The classic presentations include fetal death or thrombosis (arterial or venous thromboembolism), in the presence of persistently increased titers of antiphospholipid (apl) antibodi. If it is very low, or other antibodies are also low (or not functioning), it may be a sign of immune deficiency that can lead to more infections. Identifying unprovoked thromboembolism patients at low risk for.</p>

<p>Igm is a type of antibody you make to help fight infections. I have included the bloodwork of the cardiolipin tests. You have elevated igm levels which could indicate various conditions like macroglobulinemia, mononucleosis, early viral hepatitis, a parasite infection, rheumatoid arthritis or nephritic syndrome. A negative anticardiolipin igg or igm result indicates that this type of antibody was not present or was present in too small a quantity in the blood sample being tested.
