<p>Firstly, there are three primary types of strength: Together, they support the weight of your body and help you move. Traditional strength training focuses on producing a shortening muscle action to move a load through a single plane of motion; Thus, the muscular force can be defined as the force exerted by the muscles of our body.

<p>Isotonic muscle contractions can be either concentric (muscle shortens) or eccentric (muscle lengthens). It is a kind of force that most, if not all, of us are already familiar with. A concentric contraction is a type of muscle contraction in which the muscles shorten while generating force. Muscular force is required whenever the movement of the body occurs.

<p>Isotonic muscle contractions can be either concentric (muscle shortens) or eccentric (muscle lengthens). This can occur only when a muscle’s maximal force of contraction exceeds the total load on the muscle. The force which is applied by our muscles is called applied force is also called muscular force. When applied or muscular force on the pulley through the rope to lifting with water from the well, it is counterbalanced by the friction force between rope and lift. What is Force?
