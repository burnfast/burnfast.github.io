Benefits of resistance training include improved. Resistance training (rt) often increases muscle mass and promotes a favorable metabolic profile in people with t2d, even in the absence of fat loss. Aim exercise is one of the most important components in frailty prevention and treatment. Inactive adults experience a 3% to 8% loss of muscle mass per decade, accompanied by resting metabolic rate reduction and fat accumulation.
