<p>Normally people just send heart to give an end to the conversation, when they don't have anything to say but they can't just ignore your message so they reply with a heart. If you post a picture with a blue heart, it can also mean that you feel sorry for the person. Liking a message requires having a direct messaging conversation with another user, and doesn’t include a visible heart icon until after you’ve already liked the message. Meanwhile on instagram, 88% said they like it, which was based on a larger sample of 17 people.</p>
