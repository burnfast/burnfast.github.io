<p>Cholesterol is a risk factor for heart disease, but recent research suggests the connection may be more complex than just limiting dietary cholesterol to a specific quantity each day. Coronary heart disease can weaken the heart muscle over time and contribute to heart failure and arrhythmias. The classic signs and symptoms of a heart attack include crushing chest pain or pressure, shoulder or arm pain, shortness of breath, and sweating. It may be chronic, narrowing of the coronary artery over time and limiting of the blood supply to part of the muscle. High cholesterol and statins Page 2 Diabetes Forum • The Global.</p>
