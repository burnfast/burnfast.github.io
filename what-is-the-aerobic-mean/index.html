Importance of Aerobics From slideshare.net
Aerobic exercise a type of physical activity that increases the heart rate and promotes increased use of oxygen in order to improve the overall body condition. Aerobic fitness is a measure of the body&#39;s capacity to transport and utilize oxygen. [plural noun] a system of physical conditioning involving exercises (such as running, walking, swimming, or calisthenics) strenuously performed so as to cause marked temporary increase in respiration and heart rate. The product of respiration is a molecule called adenosine.
