The aerobic, anoxic, and anaerobic process helps prepare the waste for decomposition by attacking the organic compounds that in wastewater.
What is the difference between the results of aerobic and anaerobic From researchgate.net
For an easy understanding, few points are listed below: The aerobic, anoxic, and anaerobic process helps prepare the waste for decomposition by attacking the organic compounds that in wastewater. The word is derived from the greek “aero” and “bios” meaning “air” and “life”. The anaerobic wastewater treatment uses anaerobic bacteria that change organic matter into organisms that contain large quantities of methane gas and carbon dioxide.

<p>Anaerobic respiration occurs without oxygen and releases less energy but more quickly than aerobic respiration. Aerobic wastewater treatment process is governed by aerobic organisms which need oxygen for the breaking process. In aerobic decomposition the only microorganisms that can survive are the aerobic organisms. It isn’t as efficient as aerobic respiration, because oxygen is an extremely attractive element to the electrons that facilitate the production of atp, helping them move through the transport chain during the different stages of aerobic respiration. 3.1.6 What are the two types of anaerobic respiration YouTube.</p>

<p>So what does anaerobic mean? Respiration is a chemical reaction which takes place in all livings cells and releases energy from glucose. With oxygen, organisms can use aerobic cellular respiration to produce up to 38 molecules of atp from just one molecule of glucose.without oxygen, organisms must use anaerobic respiration to produce atp, and this process produces only two molecules of atp per molecule of glucose. The professionals at aos can discuss various municipal wastewater treatment options. Anaerobic Cellular Respiration SBI 4U Website.</p>

<p>In anoxic decomposition the microorganisms use chemically combined oxygen that is found in nitrite and nitrate. It isn’t as efficient as aerobic respiration, because oxygen is an extremely attractive element to the electrons that facilitate the production of atp, helping them move through the transport chain during the different stages of aerobic respiration. What are some examples of aerobic and anaerobic processes? The anaerobic wastewater treatment uses anaerobic bacteria that change organic matter into organisms that contain large quantities of methane gas and carbon dioxide.
