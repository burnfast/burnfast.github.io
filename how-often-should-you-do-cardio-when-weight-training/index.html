How Often Should I Do HIIT to Lose Weight? POPSUGAR Fitness From popsugar.com

Research has shown that when you lift weights before you do cardio: Most people with fat loss goals, in addition to their lifting program, do at least 3 to 4 days a week of formal cardio, usually 30 to 60 minutes at a moderate to moderately hard intensity (enough to get heart rate and breathing up). If you want to lose weight and burn fat, it’s still better to do weights first.
