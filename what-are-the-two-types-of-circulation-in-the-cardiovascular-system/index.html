The lymph, lymph nodes, and lymph vessels form the lymphatic system, which returns filtered blood plasma from the interstitial fluid (between cells) as lymph. Pulmonary circulation describes the movement of blood from the heart to the lungs. In animals, there are two types of circulatory systems: The closed circulatory system is further classified into two, based on the number of times blood circulation takes place through.
