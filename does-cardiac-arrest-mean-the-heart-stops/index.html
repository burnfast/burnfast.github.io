<p>Other possible causes of cardiac arrest include inherited abnormalities of the heart&amp;rsquo;s electrical pathways or structural changes in the heart. Causes and risk factors include drug abuse, abnormal heart rhythms, heart disease, smoking, ventricular fibrillation, high cholesterol, or previous heart attack (not inclusive). When this happens, blood flow to the brain and the rest of the body also stops. This causes an irregular heartbeat called an arrhythmia, which does not allow the heart to pump blood to the body properly.</p>
