<p>Aerobic exercise is any type of cardiovascular conditioning, or “cardio.”. Aerobic exercise is the use of your large muscles in a light to moderate way such that you can meet your oxygen needs for an extended duration of time.

<p>Why the aerobic energy system is important to cyclists. It’s a lot more complicated than this, but in essence, think of the aerobic system as using oxygen as its primary fuel source. Run of two minutes at mod/high intensity, followed by two minutes at low intensity (active recovery) repeated for 30 minutes. This can be contrasted with anaerobic exercise such as weight lifting that uses massive amounts of oxygen in a short time such that it can't be sustained for long.

<p>Glucose from carbohydrates and fats supply the energy for the aerobic energy system and can supply energy for long periods of time. As already mentioned, releasing energy is one of the inevitable processes that occurs in the body during a workout. Short surges of a few seconds are primarily anaerobic, but maximal efforts of 70 seconds see an equal energy contribution from aerobic and anaerobic sources. These physiological pathways are called energy systems, and the most important of these for endurance athletes is the aerobic energy system.let’s take a closer look at how your body utilizes the aerobic system to power you on your bike, and how you can train this system to.

<h3 id="aerobic-means-with-the-presence-of-oxygen">Aerobic Means With The Presence Of Oxygen.</h3><p>The aerobic energy system utilises fats, carbohydrates, glucose and proteins from the food we eat, in conjunction with the circulatory system, to produce adenosine triphosphate, which is also known as atp. This can be contrasted with anaerobic exercise such as weight lifting that uses massive amounts of oxygen in a short time such that it can't be sustained for long. Examples of training that is primarily focused on the aerobic system are: The great difference between both modes of exercise is, as we have already said, the presence or absence of oxygen as a mechanism for obtaining immediate energy.</p>
