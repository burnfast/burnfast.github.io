Build muscle lose fat From 2016risksummit.org
Your body needs 2 things in order to gain muscle….you need to push your muscles to the point that they’re prompted to rebuild bigger/stronger and then you need enough calories &amp; protein to them build that muscle tissue. A significant gain in muscle mass due to the resistance of swimming may also increase weight. Successful weight gain requires that you increase your daily intake of carbohydrates. Eat healthy carbs immediately before and after your workouts.
