As long as the systolic pressure does not go beyond 220 mmhg, it will not damage the heart, kidneys, brain and eyes. This column discusses resistance training guidelines, safety guidelines and safety protocols for individuals with hypertension. Resistance training was the sole intervention; Previous research has shown isometric resistance training (irt) to lower systolic and diastolic blood pressure, but there have been safety concerns.
