<meta name="description" content="Simple What Does High Cardiolipin Igm Mean For Everyone, The disease is characterized by decreased levels of immunoglobulin g (igg) in the blood and normal or elevated levels of igm. The anti cardiolipin igm antibody test enables you to diagnose inappropriate blood clot, analyze the cause for regular miscarriages, and analyze any autoimmune diseases.

What does the test result mean? The persistent presence of igg and/or igm cardiolipin (cl) antibodies in moderate or high levels (greater than 40 gpl and/or greater than 40 mpl units) is a laboratory criterion for the diagnosis of antiphospholipid syndrome (aps). Igm is our first defense against bacteria, so if you have an active infection it can be the cause of this elevation. They help to regulate the way the blood is able to clot when an injury occurs, though the process of it is not completely.

<p>Cardiolipin antibody tests are usually reported as a positive or negative result. A negative result means only that the cardiolipin antibody class tested (igg, igm, and/or iga) is not present at this time.

<p>I would like to know what having an elevated cardiolipin igm means. Keep reading to learn more about high and low igm levels and the factors that may affect them. Since cardiolipin antibodies are the most common of the antiphospholipid antibodies, it is not unusual to find them emerging, temporarily due to an infection or drug, or a symptomatically as.

<p>When the antibodies attack cardiolipin, blood clots can occur. A cardiolipin antibodies test looks for a certain kind of antibody in your blood. Discuss with your doctor these speculations and see if any better reasoning comes up.
