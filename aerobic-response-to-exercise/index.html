Physiological Responses to Exercise. Anaerobic vs. Aerobic DANIEL From danielmarkfitness.wordpress.com
These “aerobic” exercises do not improve vo2max. Typically, aerobic training causes your heart to beat at a range of 70 to 80 percent of its maximum. This is because we have very unique genetic differences. As exercise began, vo2 showed a rapid increase from the resting value.
