<p>Aerobic cellular respiration is the process of breaking down glucose to form intermittent electron electron carriers, which eventually donate their electrons to the final electron acceptor, oxygen, at the end of the electron transport chain. This type of respiration is common in most of the plants and animals, birds, humans, and other mammals. Since both glucose and oxygen are needed for cellular respiration, we call these the âreactants.â. Aerobic respiration is more efficient than.</p>

The presence of oxygen during aerobic respiration allows for the production of large quantities of atp because oxygen is a superior electron acceptor to other elements. This process generates carbon dioxide as a byproduct and atp, the cell's energy currency. Therefore, this type of cellular respiration does not use oxygen to produce energy.</p>
