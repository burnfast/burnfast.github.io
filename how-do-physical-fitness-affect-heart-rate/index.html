There can be a dramatic difference in the number of times a person&#39;s heart beats if they are fit and unfit.
What is Heart Rate Variability and What Can It Tell Us About Our Health From knowledgeasmedicine.com
The answer is your greatest heart rate and refers to the number of heart beats per minute. The more efficient an individual’s heart is (or, how well it sends nutrients to those hard working muscles), the more fit that person typically is. To develop and maintain cardiovascular fitness, this exercise should be performed at a frequency of 3 to 5 days per week, an intensity of 60% to 90% hrmax or 50% to 85% hrmax reserve, and a duration of 20 to 60. Being physically active is one of the best ways to keep your heart and lungs healthy.

<p>Endurance exercise is any activity that uses large muscle groups, can be performed continuously, and is rhythmic and aerobic in nature. An athlete’s heart muscle has built up overtime and become stronger due to the constant exercise an athlete participates in. It allows it to pump a greater amount of blood with each heartbeat. This means the heart beats fewer times per minute than it would in a nonathlete.</p>
