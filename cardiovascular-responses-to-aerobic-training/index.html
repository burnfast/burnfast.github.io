<p>Aerobic exercise training leads to cardiovascular changes that markedly increase aerobic power and lead to improved endurance performance. Current public health recommendations are for adults to be physically active at a moderate intensity for 150 min or greater per week at a vigorous intensity for 75 min or greater per week or a combination thereof ().these recommendations are based on studies showing that exercise training improves various cardiovascular, metabolic, and psychological measures (). Resting heart rate trained athletes have a lower resting heart rate due to increased efficiency of the cardiovascular system and higher stroke volume this is most evident in the recovery phases the trained athlete can recover faster (hr ’s faster) due to a more efficient. Several parallels therefore emerge between adaptation to the hypoxia of high altitude and adaptation to the struggle for oxygen created by exercise training at low altitude.

Most of the cardiovascular changes that occur during exercise are brought about by changes in autonomic nerve activity, triggered by the cardiovascular centre. During exercise, the metabolic demands of the body increase, and changes in the cardiovascular system are required to maintain adequate perfusion.

Exercise training with blood flow restriction (bfr) is characterized by the application of an inflatable cuff to the proximal portion of the limb aiming to decrease venous return to a muscle.the limited blood supply is an important trigger for muscle adaptations and, thus, it is a potent therapy to improve muscle mass, strength, and functionality even when it is.
