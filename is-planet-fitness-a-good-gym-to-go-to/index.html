Gym in Wall Township, NJ 1919 Route 35 Fitness From planetfitness.com
Yeah but it is only 10 dollars a month. The gym at my college isn&#39;t that great and is lacking quite a few things. Planet fitness is a better choice if you travel a lot within the us, but world gym is a better option if you travel internationally frequently. When it comes to weights.

<p>I could use some advice. The gym also has a limit of 80 lbs. So i’ve told you how bad planet fitness is, but is it as bad as it seems?

<p>Actually, not as bad as it seems. It’s especially not a good look for planet fitness through the lifting communities’ eyes. I'd heard things about planet fitness gyms that i found hard to believe.

<p>I just want to know if it's a credible gym and what makes a gym credible. Planet fitness is a large international chain of gyms that has millions of clients that enjoy the ability to walk into almost any branch, have the same equipment, and be able to enjoy similar environments at each location. Sometimes certain pieces, like treadmills, will also have a weight limit. It lacks basic pieces of strength equipment and has strict rules about lifting weights.
